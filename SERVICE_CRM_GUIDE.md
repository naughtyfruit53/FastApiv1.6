## Material Tracking for Service Jobs

### Spare Parts Management

**Inventory Integration:**
```
Service module integrates with inventory:
- View available spare parts
- Check stock at all locations
- See warehouse vs. technician van stock
- Real-time stock updates
```

### Recording Material Usage

**Step 1: Start Service Job**
```
Technician accepts ticket TKT123456
Issue: "Laptop screen broken"
Required Part: 15.6" LCD Screen
```

**Step 2: Check Part Availability**
```
Technician checks:
Inventory → Spare Parts → Search "15.6 LCD"
Stock: 3 units in main warehouse
       1 unit in Tech Van 02 (my van)
Action: Use part from my van
```

**Step 3: Issue Part to Ticket**
```
Ticket TKT123456 → Materials → Add Material
- Part: 15.6" LCD Screen
- Quantity: 1
- Serial Number: LCD-SN-001 (if serialized)
- Source: Tech Van 02
- Usage Type: Installed (vs. Consumed/Returned)

System Actions:
✓ Deducts 1 unit from Tech Van 02 stock
✓ Links part to ticket for warranty tracking
✓ Updates part cost in ticket
✓ If chargeable, adds to invoice
✓ Records serial number against customer
```

**Step 4: Complete Service**
```
Technician marks:
- Part Installed: Yes
- Old Part Removed: Yes (Serial: LCD-SN-OLD-123)
- Return to Warehouse: Yes (for refurbishment)
- Customer Satisfaction: Satisfied

System Actions:

✓ Updates warranty expiry date
```

### Material Types in Service

**1. Installed Parts**
```
Parts that become part of customer's equipment:
- Hard drives, RAM, screens
- Permanently installed
- Serial number tracked
- Warranty starts from installation date
```

**2. Consumables**
```
Items consumed during service:
- Cleaning materials, lubricants
- Cables, screws, fasteners
- Not individually tracked
- Bulk issued to technician van
```

**3. Loaner Equipment**
```
Temporary equipment given to customer:
- Loaner laptop while theirs is being repaired

```

**4. Returned Parts (RMA)**
```
Faulty parts returned to vendor:
- Under warranty
- Create RMA (Return Material Authorization)
- Track return status
- Get replacement or credit
```

### Technician Van Stock

**Van Inventory Management:**
```
Each technician van has:
- Assigned stock items
- Par levels (minimum stock)
- Replenishment triggers
- Physical audit schedule

Example Van Stock:
Part                  | Par Level | Current | Status
LCD 15.6"            | 3         | 1       | 🟠 Below par
Laptop Batteries     | 5         | 6       | ✅ OK
RAM 8GB DDR4         | 4         | 0       | 🔴 Out of stock
Network Cables       | 10        | 12      | ✅ OK
```

**Auto-Replenishment:**
```
When van stock falls below par level:
- System creates "Van Replenishment" request
- Warehouse prepares parts
- Technician picks up or parts delivered
- Update van stock
```

**Van Audit:**
```
Weekly/Monthly audit:
- Technician scans all parts in van
- System compares physical vs. system stock
- Variance report generated
- Discrepancies investigated
```

### Material Costing and Billing

**Warranty Parts:**
```
If customer under warranty:
- Part cost: Borne by company
- Labor cost: Borne by company
- Not invoiced to customer
- Track warranty claims for vendor reimbursement
```

**Out-of-Warranty Parts:**
```
If customer out of warranty:
- Part cost: Customer's cost + markup
- Labor cost: Service charge
- Generate invoice
- Link to ticket for reference
```

**Service Contract:**
```
If customer has AMC (Annual Maintenance Contract):
- Depends on contract terms
- Some parts covered, some not
- Track part usage against contract quota
- Alert if nearing limit
```

## SLA Policies and Management

### Understanding SLA

**Service Level Agreement (SLA)** defines:
- Expected response time
- Expected resolution time
- Penalties for breach
- Business hours definition
- Escalation procedures

### Creating SLA Policies

**Step 1: Define Business Hours**
```
Settings → Service Desk → Business Hours

Example:
- Name: "Standard Business Hours"
- Monday-Friday: 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM
- Saturday: 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM
- Sunday: Closed
- Holidays: Defined separately
```

**Step 2: Create SLA Policy**
```
Settings → Service Desk → SLA Policies → Create New

Policy Name: "Premium Customer SLA"
Applicable To:
- Customer Type: Premium
- Priority: All
- Category: All

Response Time Targets:
- Urgent: 30 minutes
- High: 2 hours
- Medium: 8 hours
- Low: 24 hours

Resolution Time Targets:
- Urgent: 4 hours
- High: 8 hours
- Medium: 2 business days
- Low: 5 business days

Escalation Rules:
- If 80% of response time passed, notify supervisor
- If 100% of response time breached, escalate to supervisor
- If 80% of resolution time passed, escalate to manager
```

**Step 3: Assign SLA to Customers**
```
Customer Profile → SLA Policy → Select "Premium Customer SLA"
All tickets from this customer will follow this SLA.
```

### SLA Tracking

**Real-Time SLA Status:**
```
Ticket Dashboard shows:
🟢 Green: Within SLA, no risk
🟡 Yellow: 80% time elapsed, close to breach
🔴 Red: SLA breached, immediate action needed
```

**SLA Timers:**
```
Ticket TKT123456:
- Created: 10:00 AM
- SLA Response Due: 10:30 AM (Urgent - 30 mins)
- Actual First Response: 10:25 AM ✅ Met
- SLA Resolution Due: 2:00 PM (Urgent - 4 hours)
- Current Time: 1:00 PM
- Time Remaining: 1 hour 🟢 On track
```

**SLA Pause Scenarios:**
```
SLA timer pauses when:
- Ticket status: "Pending Customer" (waiting for customer input)
- Outside business hours
- Holidays
- Customer-requested delay

SLA timer resumes when:
- Customer responds
- Business hours resume
- Ticket reassigned to technician
```

### SLA Escalation Workflow

**Automatic Escalation:**
```
Ticket TKT789 - Network Down - Urgent Priority
10:00 AM: Ticket created, assigned to Tech-01
10:30 AM: Response SLA breaches (no response in 30 mins)
         → System auto-assigns to Supervisor
         → Email alert to Supervisor and Manager
         → Tech-01 gets warning notification

11:00 AM: Supervisor contacts customer, provides update
2:00 PM:  Resolution SLA due at 2:00 PM
1:30 PM:  Supervisor checks progress (80% alert)
1:45 PM:  Issue resolved, ticket marked resolved
         → SLA Met ✅
```

**Manual Escalation:**
```
Technician realizes issue is complex:
- Clicks "Escalate Ticket"
- Selects reason: "Requires senior technical expertise"
- Adds notes: "Issue involves firewall configuration"
- Escalates to Senior Network Engineer
- SLA timer continues (time pressure maintained)
```

### SLA Reports
