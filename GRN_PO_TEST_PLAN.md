### 3. GRN Frontend Enhancements
- Fixed PO dropdown to only remove fully completed POs (grn_status='complete')
- Added toast notification with link when GRN is created

## Test Cases

### A. GRN Creation Tests

#### Test Case A1: Create GRN from Purchase Order
**Preconditions:**
- A Purchase Order exists with multiple line items
- User is logged in with appropriate permissions

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to GRN page
2. Select "Purchase Order" as voucher type
3. Select a PO from the dropdown
4. Verify items are auto-populated
5. Enter received quantities for each item
6. Enter accepted and rejected quantities
7. Verify: accepted + rejected â‰¤ received for each item
8. Save the GRN

**Expected Results:**
- Items are correctly populated from PO
- Validation prevents accepted + rejected > received
- Toast notification appears with link to created GRN
- PO items' delivered_quantity is updated
- PO items' pending_quantity is updated correctly

#### Test Case A2: Partial GRN from Purchase Order
**Steps:**
1. Create a GRN with partial quantities (e.g., 50 out of 100 ordered)
2. Check the PO dropdown after saving
3. Verify PO still appears in dropdown
4. Check PO color coding

**Expected Results:**
- PO should still be available in GRN dropdown (not removed)
- PO color should be yellow (partial)
- PO items show correct delivered_quantity and pending_quantity

#### Test Case A3: Complete GRN from Purchase Order
**Steps:**
1. Create a GRN with all remaining quantities
2. Check the PO dropdown after saving
3. Verify PO disappears from dropdown
4. Check PO color coding

**Expected Results:**
- PO should NOT appear in GRN dropdown (removed)
- PO color should be green (complete)
- PO items show pending_quantity = 0

#### Test Case A4: Multiple GRNs for Single PO
**Steps:**
1. Create first GRN with partial quantities (e.g., 40 out of 100)
2. Create second GRN with more quantities (e.g., 30 out of remaining 60)
3. Create third GRN with final quantities (e.g., 30 out of remaining 30)
4. Verify cumulative quantities

**Expected Results:**
- Each GRN correctly updates delivered_quantity
- Pending_quantity decreases correctly after each GRN
- Final GRN marks PO as complete (green)
- PO removed from dropdown only after complete
