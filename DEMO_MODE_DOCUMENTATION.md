## QA Testing Procedures

### Test Cases

#### Demo Access Testing
1. **Login Page Demo Button**
   - Verify button appears and is clickable
   - Confirm dialog opens with proper content
   - Test user type selection functionality

2. **Users Page Demo Button**
   - Verify button appears for admin users only
   - Confirm proper role-based access control
   - Test integration with existing user management

#### User Flow Testing
3. **Current User Flow**
   - Test user type selection
   - Verify redirect to login page
   - Confirm demo mode activation after login
   - Validate demo page access

4. **New User Flow**
   - Test form validation and submission
   - Verify OTP sending simulation
   - Test OTP verification (accept any 6-digit code)
   - Confirm temporary session creation

#### Demo Mode Functionality
5. **Demo Environment Testing**
   - Verify all modules are accessible
   - Confirm sample data loads correctly
   - Test that no real data is affected
   - Validate demo mode indicators

6. **Session Management Testing**
   - Test demo mode toggle functionality
   - Verify exit demo behavior for both user types
   - Confirm session cleanup for temporary users
   - Test browser close behavior for temporary users

#### Data Safety Testing
7. **Data Isolation Testing**
   - Confirm demo operations don't affect production data
   - Verify sample data consistency
   - Test that demo changes don't persist
   - Validate proper data source separation

#### UI/UX Testing
8. **Visual Indicators Testing**
   - Verify demo mode alerts appear consistently
   - Test demo mode toggle functionality
   - Confirm temporary user warnings show properly
   - Validate demo indicators throughout interface

### Regression Testing
- **Authentication Flow**: Ensure normal login still works
- **Existing Features**: Verify no impact on current functionality
- **Role-Based Access**: Confirm RBAC still functions correctly
- **Performance**: Validate no performance degradation

### Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome**: Test all demo features
- **Firefox**: Verify compatibility
- **Safari**: Test on macOS/iOS
- **Edge**: Ensure Microsoft compatibility
- **Mobile**: Test responsive design on mobile devices

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- **No Real Data Exposure**: Demo mode completely isolated from production
- **Temporary Sessions**: New user sessions automatically expire
- **Local Storage**: Demo flags stored locally, not on server
- **No Persistence**: Temporary demo users don't create database records

### Access Control
- **Role Preservation**: Current users maintain their actual permissions
- **Demo Limitations**: Temporary users have limited, read-only access
- **Session Validation**: Proper session management for all user types
- **Audit Trail**: Demo activities can be logged separately if needed

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Demo Mode Not Activating**: Check localStorage flags and browser console
2. **OTP Not Working**: Verify any 6-digit number should work in demo
3. **Session Expires**: Expected behavior for temporary users
4. **Missing Sample Data**: Check demo data loading and API responses
