## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: No Shortage âœ…
**Setup**: MO with all materials in stock  
**Expected**: No dialog, order created immediately  
**Status**: Tested manually

### Scenario 2: Critical Shortage (No PO) âœ…
**Setup**: MO with material shortage, no purchase order  
**Expected**: Red alert dialog with recommendations  
**Status**: Tested manually

### Scenario 3: Warning Shortage (PO Placed) âœ…
**Setup**: MO with material shortage, PO exists  
**Expected**: Yellow warning dialog with PO details  
**Status**: Tested manually

### Scenario 4: Mixed Shortages âœ…
**Setup**: MO with multiple shortage items (some with PO, some without)  
**Expected**: Dialog shows both critical and warning items  
**Status**: Tested manually

### Scenario 5: Manual Check âœ…
**Setup**: Existing MO, user clicks "Check Shortages" button  
**Expected**: Dialog shows current shortage status  
**Status**: Tested manually

### Scenario 6: API Error âœ…
**Setup**: Backend error during shortage check  
**Expected**: Graceful error handling, user can still proceed  
**Status**: Tested manually

---

## Performance Validation

- [x] Additional PO query adds minimal overhead
- [x] No N+1 query issues
- [x] Async operations don't block UI
- [x] Loading states prevent double-submission
- [x] Dialog renders quickly

---

## Security Validation

- [x] Authentication required for all endpoints
- [x] Organization scoping enforced
- [x] No sensitive data exposed
- [x] Proper authorization checks in place
- [x] XSS prevention in frontend (Material-UI handles)

---

## Compatibility Check

### Backend Compatibility âœ…
- [x] Existing MO creation still works
- [x] Existing MO update still works
- [x] Optional parameter for PO checking (backward compatible)
- [x] No changes to database schema
- [x] No changes to existing models

### Frontend Compatibility âœ…
- [x] Works with existing production order page
- [x] Components are optional (can be removed without breaking)
- [x] No breaking changes to existing components
- [x] Graceful degradation if API unavailable

---

## Documentation Coverage

### User Documentation âœ…
- [x] Enhanced shortage handling explained
- [x] Color coding documented
- [x] User workflow documented

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Arise

1. **Frontend Rollback**
   ```typescript
   // Remove shortage checking from onSubmit
   // Comment out ManufacturingShortageAlert import
   // Revert to original submit handler
   ```

2. **Backend Rollback**
   ```python
   # Set include_po_status=False by default in check_material_availability_for_mo
   # This disables PO checking but keeps everything else working
   ```

3. **Full Rollback**
   - Revert to commit before this PR
   - No database changes to undo
   - No data loss
