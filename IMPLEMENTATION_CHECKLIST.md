## Testing Requirements üîÑ

### Automated Testing
- [x] TypeScript type checking passes
- [ ] Unit tests for `isIntrastate` calculation (no existing test infrastructure)

### Manual Testing (Requires Running Application)
- [ ] **Test 1**: Create intrastate voucher (CGST + SGST)
- [ ] **Test 2**: Create interstate voucher (IGST)
- [ ] **Test 3**: Switch between intrastate and interstate vendors
- [ ] **Test 4**: Switch back from interstate to intrastate
- [ ] **Test 5**: Edit mode - load and modify voucher
- [ ] **Test 6**: Financial vouchers (payment/receipt with multiple entity types)
- [ ] **Test 7**: Manufacturing vouchers (job cards with vendor selection)
- [ ] **Test 8**: Entity without state code (edge case)
- [ ] **Test 9**: Company without state code (edge case)
- [ ] **Test 10**: Rapid entity switching (performance test)

### Browser Testing (Requires Running Application)

- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari
- [ ] Edge

## Rollback Plan üîÑ

If critical issues are discovered:
1. Revert commits 22aaaf6, 2fd1c7b, 5eb4669, 3e7e033
2. Notify stakeholders
3. Investigate with additional logging
4. Re-implement with alternative approach

- Does not address backend validation issues
- Assumes backend APIs work correctly
- No unit/integration tests added (repository lacks test infrastructure)
- Manual UI testing required for full validation

## Next Steps üéØ

1. **Immediate**: Request review from repository owner
2. **Before Merge**: Complete manual testing with running application
3. **After Merge**: Monitor production for any issues
4. **Future**: Add unit tests when test infrastructure is available
