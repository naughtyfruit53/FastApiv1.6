## 🚀 Deployment Readiness

### Environment Variables Required

```bash
# AfterShip Configuration
AFTERSHIP_API_KEY=asat_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
AFTERSHIP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here
AFTERSHIP_ENABLED=true
```

### Database Migrations

No new migrations required. The async changes use existing schema.

### Dependencies

All dependencies already in requirements.txt:
- `aiohttp` (for AfterShip API calls)
- `sqlalchemy[asyncio]` (for async database)
- `fastapi` (framework)

### Testing Checklist

Before production deployment:

- [ ] Test AfterShip API with real API key
- [ ] Configure webhook URL in AfterShip dashboard
- [ ] Test webhook signature verification
- [ ] Test chatbot responses
- [ ] Test manufacturing endpoints with async database
- [ ] Load test async endpoints
- [ ] Verify email notifications work
- [ ] Test bulk tracking operations

### Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Feature flags can disable AfterShip integration (`AFTERSHIP_ENABLED=false`)
2. Chatbot changes are backward compatible
3. Async manufacturing is backward compatible with API contracts
4. Guides are documentation-only, no rollback needed
