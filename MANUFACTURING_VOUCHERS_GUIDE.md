## Manufacturing Order Workflow

### Creating a Manufacturing Order

A Manufacturing Order (MO) is the starting point for any production activity.

**Step 1: Select BOM**
```
Navigate to: Manufacturing â†’ Manufacturing Orders â†’ Create New
- Select the Bill of Materials (BOM) for the product to manufacture
- System validates BOM exists and is active
```

**Step 2: Define Quantities and Schedule**
```
- Planned Quantity: How many units to produce
- Planned Start Date: When production should begin
- Planned End Date: Target completion date
- Priority: Low/Medium/High/Urgent
```

**Step 3: Assign Department and Location**
```
- Production Department: Which department will handle production
- Production Location: Specific production facility or floor
- Notes: Any special instructions
```

**Step 4: System Actions**
```
âœ“ Generates unique MO number (e.g., MO/2526/00001)
âœ“ Calculates estimated cost from BOM
âœ“ Creates MO in "planned" status
âœ“ Reserves materials (optional, based on settings)
```

### Manufacturing Order Statuses

| Status | Description | Actions Available |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Planned** | MO created but not started | Edit, Delete, Start |
| **In Progress** | Production has begun | Issue Materials, Update Progress |
| **Completed** | All planned quantity produced | View Only |
| **On Hold** | Temporarily paused | Resume, Cancel |
| **Cancelled** | Production cancelled | View Only |

## Stock Deduction Process

### Material Issue for Production

When materials are consumed in production, create a Material Issue (MI) voucher.

**Step 1: Link to Manufacturing Order**
```
Navigate to: Manufacturing â†’ Material Issues â†’ Create New
- Select Manufacturing Order
- System loads BOM materials automatically
```

**Step 2: Issue Materials**
```
For each material:
- Product: Auto-populated from BOM
- Quantity: Actual quantity being issued
- Unit: Unit of measure
- Unit Price: Current stock valuation
- Notes: Batch number, quality notes, etc.
```

**Step 3: System Stock Deduction**
```
âœ“ Validates sufficient stock is available
âœ“ Deducts quantity from inventory
âœ“ Updates product stock levels
âœ“ Records transaction in stock ledger
âœ“ Links to Manufacturing Order
âœ“ Updates MO material consumption tracking
```

### Stock Deduction Rules

**Automatic Deduction:**
- Stock is deducted immediately upon MI approval
- FIFO (First In First Out) method used by default
- Batch/serial tracking maintained if enabled
- Stock valuation updated in real-time

**Validation Checks:**
- Cannot issue more than available stock (unless negative stock allowed)
- Cannot issue to completed/cancelled Manufacturing Orders
- Requires appropriate user permissions

**Reversal Process:**
If materials need to be returned:
1. Create Material Receipt Voucher (Type: Return)
2. Link to original Material Issue
3. Stock is added back to inventory
4. Original MI marked as "Partially Returned" or "Fully Returned"

---

## Production Addition

### Recording Production Output

Use Manufacturing Journal Vouchers (MJV) to record completed production.

**Step 1: Create MJV**
```
Navigate to: Manufacturing â†’ Manufacturing Journal â†’ Create New
- Select Manufacturing Order
- Select BOM Version
- Enter Finished Product details
```

**Step 2: Record Finished Goods**
```
Finished Products:
- Product: The main output product
- Quantity Produced: Actual production quantity
- Unit Rate: Cost per unit (calculated from materials + overhead)
- Quality Grade: A/B/C grade (if applicable)
- Notes: Production notes, quality remarks
```

**Step 3: Record By-products (if any)**
```
By-products:
- Product: Secondary output
- Quantity: Amount produced
- Unit Rate: Valuation rate
- Notes: Quality, grade, etc.
```

**Step 4: Record Scrap/Waste (if any)**
```
Scrap Materials:
- Material: What was scrapped
- Quantity: Amount wasted
- Reason: Quality issue, spillage, etc.
- Value: Scrap value (if recoverable)
```

**Step 5: System Actions**
```
âœ“ Adds finished goods to inventory
âœ“ Adds by-products to inventory
âœ“ Deducts scrap value from production cost
âœ“ Updates Manufacturing Order progress
âœ“ Calculates actual vs. planned variance
âœ“ Updates product costing
```

### Production Costing

**Actual Production Cost Calculation:**
```
Total Production Cost = 
  Material Cost (from Material Issues)
  + Labor Cost (if tracked)
  + Overhead Cost (if allocated)
  - Scrap Value
  - By-product Value
  
Cost Per Unit = Total Production Cost / Quantity Produced
```

## Shortage Alerts

### Real-Time Shortage Detection

The system automatically monitors material availability for production.

**Alert Triggers:**

1. **Below Reorder Level**
   - Alert: ðŸŸ¡ Yellow warning
   - Triggered when: Stock < Reorder Level
   - Action: Place purchase order

2. **Below Minimum Stock**
   - Alert: ðŸŸ  Orange alert
   - Triggered when: Stock < Minimum Stock Level
   - Action: Urgent procurement needed

3. **Insufficient for MO**
   - Alert: ðŸ”´ Red critical
   - Triggered when: Available stock < MO requirement
   - Action: Cannot start production, procure immediately

4. **Out of Stock**
   - Alert: ðŸ”´ Red critical
   - Triggered when: Stock = 0
   - Action: Production blocked, emergency procurement

### Viewing Shortage Alerts

**Dashboard Widget:**
```
Manufacturing Dashboard â†’ Material Shortages
- Shows all materials below reorder level
- Indicates which MOs are affected

- Minimum Stock: Safety stock threshold
- Lead Time: Days to procure
- Economic Order Quantity: Optimal order size

System calculates: 
Reorder Level = (Average Daily Usage Ã— Lead Time) + Safety Stock
```

### Automated Actions

**Email Notifications:**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue 1: "Insufficient Stock" error when issuing materials**
```
Problem: Stock level shows insufficient quantity
Solutions:
1. Check if stock is allocated to other orders
2. Verify if correct warehouse is selected
3. Check if batch/serial selection is correct
4. Create emergency purchase or transfer from another location
```

**Issue 2: Manufacturing Order stuck in "In Progress"**
```
Problem: Cannot close MO even after production complete
Solutions:
1. Ensure all Material Issues are accounted for
2. Create Manufacturing Journal for all produced quantity
3. Check if there are pending approvals
4. Verify all linked documents are in "Completed" status
```

**Issue 3: Incorrect production cost calculation**
```
Problem: Cost per unit doesn't match expected value
Solutions:
1. Verify all Material Issues are linked to the MO
2. Check if labor and overhead are properly allocated
3. Ensure by-product and scrap values are recorded
4. Review BOM cost calculation
5. Check for any manual adjustments
```

**Issue 4: Job Card not closing**
```
Problem: Cannot close Job Card Voucher
Solutions:
1. Ensure Delivery Challan is marked "Returned"
2. Verify all expected outputs are received
3. Check if job work invoice is recorded
4. Ensure all material reconciliation is complete
```

**Issue 5: Batch tracking not working**
```
Problem: System not asking for batch selection
Solutions:
1. Check if "Track by Batch" is enabled for the product
2. Ensure batches are created in the system
3. Verify user has permission to view batches
4. Check if batch tracking is enabled at org level
```
