# Mobile Compatibility, QC Integration, and Product File Upload Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of three major features:
1. Mobile Compatibility improvements
2. Inward Material QC Integration for GRN
3. Product File Attachment feature

## Implementation Date
October 2025

## Features Implemented

### 1. Mobile Compatibility Fixes

#### Changes Made:
- **CSS Touch-Action**: Added `touch-action: manipulation` to prevent double-tap zoom on mobile devices
  - File: `frontend/src/styles/mobile/mobile-theme.css`
  - Prevents accidental zoom when users interact with buttons and form elements

- **Viewport Meta Tag**: Verified and confirmed proper viewport settings
  - File: `frontend/src/pages/_app.tsx`
  - Settings: `width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover`
  - Supports iOS safe area with `viewport-fit=cover`

- **Mobile Theme Integration**: Mobile CSS is already loaded in `_app.tsx`
  - File: `frontend/src/styles/mobile/mobile-theme.css`
  - Includes touch-friendly sizing variables
  - Responsive breakpoints for different devices

#### Testing:
- Created Playwright tests for mobile device emulation
- File: `tests/mobile/integration/mobile-compatibility.spec.ts`
- Tests devices: iPhone 12, Samsung Galaxy S21, iPad
- Validates touch targets, navigation, and responsive layout

### 2. Inward Material QC Integration

#### New Component: InwardMaterialQCModal
**File**: `frontend/src/components/InwardMaterialQCModal.tsx`

**Features:**
- Full-screen modal for quality check on received items
- Fields:
  - Inspection Date (auto-filled with current date)
  - Inspector Name
  - Accepted Quantity (with validation)
  - Rejected Quantity (with validation)
  - QC Result (auto-calculated: pass/fail/partial)
  - Rejection Reason (required if rejected_quantity > 0)
  - Measurements (optional)
  - Remarks (optional)
  - File Attachments (up to 5 files, 5MB each)

**Validation:**
- Accepted + Rejected quantities cannot exceed Received quantity
- Rejection reason is required when items are rejected
- File size limit: 5MB per file
- File count limit: 5 files per QC record

**Auto-Calculation:**
- QC Result is automatically calculated:
  - `pass`: All items accepted (rejected_quantity = 0)
  - `fail`: All items rejected (accepted_quantity = 0)
  - `partial`: Some items accepted, some rejected

#### Integration with GRN Page
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/vouchers/Purchase-Vouchers/grn.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. Added QC modal state management:
   ```typescript
   const [qcModalOpen, setQcModalOpen] = useState(false);
   const [selectedQcItem, setSelectedQcItem] = useState<any | null>(null);
   ```

2. Updated QC button in items table:
   - Removed placeholder alert
   - Opens QC modal with item data
   - Passes product name, quantities, unit

3. QC data handling:
   - Stores QC data in form state for backend submission
   - Updates accepted/rejected quantities in GRN item
   - Saves QC metadata (inspector, date, result, etc.)

**Button Location**: In the "Edit" column of the GRN items table, next to the Edit icon

**Backend Support**: GRN model already has QC-related fields:
- `GoodsReceiptNoteItem.quality_status`
- `GoodsReceiptNoteItem.accepted_quantity`
- `GoodsReceiptNoteItem.rejected_quantity`
- `GoodsReceiptNote.inspection_status`

### 3. Product File Attachments

#### Integration with AddProductModal
**File**: `frontend/src/components/AddProductModal.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. Added Tabs component for navigation:
   - Tab 1: Basic Information (existing product form)
   - Tab 2: Files (ProductFileUpload component)

2. Tab State Management:
   ```typescript
   const [currentTab, setCurrentTab] = useState(0);
   const [savedProductId, setSavedProductId] = useState<number | undefined>(undefined);
   ```

3. Files tab is:
   - Disabled when adding new product (product must be saved first)
   - Enabled in edit mode (when product ID exists)

4. ProductFileUpload component shows:
   - Drag-and-drop upload area
   - File count indicator (X/5)
   - List of uploaded files with download/delete buttons
   - File size display
   - File type icons (üìÑ for PDF, üñºÔ∏è for images, etc.)

#### Backend API Support
**File**: `app/api/products.py`

**Endpoints** (already implemented):
- `POST /api/v1/products/{product_id}/files` - Upload file
- `GET /api/v1/products/{product_id}/files` - List files
- `GET /api/v1/products/{product_id}/files/{file_id}/download` - Download file
- `DELETE /api/v1/products/{product_id}/files/{file_id}` - Delete file

**Features:**
- File size limit: 10MB per file
- File count limit: 5 files per product
- Supports any file format
- Files stored in `Uploads/products/` directory
- Database model: `ProductFile` (already in `app/models/product_models.py`)

#### Product List Enhancement
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/masters/products.tsx`

**Note**: The product list already calls the backend with `selectinload(Product.files)`, so files are included in the product response. Future enhancement could display file count badge in the product table.

## Testing

### Test Files Created:
1. `tests/test_mobile_qc_product_files.py` - Backend and integration tests
2. `tests/mobile/integration/mobile-compatibility.spec.ts` - Mobile device tests

### Test Coverage:
- ‚úÖ Mobile CSS includes touch-action
- ‚úÖ Viewport meta tag exists
- ‚úÖ QC modal component exists and is integrated
- ‚úÖ Product file upload component exists and is integrated
- ‚úÖ AddProductModal includes file upload tabs
- ‚úÖ GRN page includes QC modal
- ‚úÖ Product file upload/download/delete (backend)
- ‚úÖ File limit enforcement (max 5 files)
- ‚úÖ File size validation (max 10MB)
- ‚úÖ GRN QC fields in backend model

### Running Tests:

**Simple file-based tests:**
```bash
python -c "
# Test mobile CSS includes touch-action
mobile_css_path = 'frontend/src/styles/mobile/mobile-theme.css'
with open(mobile_css_path, 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()
    assert 'touch-action: manipulation' in content
    print('‚úì Mobile CSS includes touch-action')
# ... (other tests)
"
```

**Playwright mobile tests:**
```bash
npx playwright test tests/mobile/integration/mobile-compatibility.spec.ts
```

**Backend tests** (requires test database setup):
```bash
pytest tests/test_mobile_qc_product_files.py
```

## Technical Notes

### File Storage:
- Product files: `Uploads/products/{uuid}{extension}`
- Files are stored with UUID filenames to prevent conflicts
- Original filenames are preserved in database

### Database Schema:
```sql
-- ProductFile table (already exists)
CREATE TABLE product_files (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INTEGER REFERENCES products(id),
    organization_id INTEGER REFERENCES organizations(id),
    filename VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    original_filename VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    file_path VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    file_size INTEGER NOT NULL,
    content_type VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- GRN QC fields (already exist in GoodsReceiptNoteItem)
-- accepted_quantity FLOAT
-- rejected_quantity FLOAT
-- quality_status VARCHAR
-- remarks TEXT
```

### Component Dependencies:
- Material-UI (MUI) for UI components
- React Hook Form for form management
- React Query for data fetching
- Next.js for routing and SSR

## Browser Support
- Chrome/Edge (desktop and mobile)
- Safari (desktop and mobile/iOS)
- Firefox (desktop and mobile)
- Samsung Internet (mobile)

## Known Limitations
1. QC file uploads are currently stored in form state but not persisted to backend
2. File preview is not implemented (download to view)
3. Mobile tests require Playwright setup
4. Product files don't appear in product list table yet

## Migration Notes
- No database migrations required
- All necessary tables and fields already exist
- Only frontend components were added/modified
- Backend API was already implemented

## Performance Considerations
- File uploads are limited to 10MB to prevent server overload
- Files are stored locally (consider cloud storage for production)
- Product queries use eager loading for files (may impact large lists)
- QC modal uses controlled form components (good performance)

## Security Considerations
- File uploads validate organization_id to prevent unauthorized access
- Files are served through authenticated endpoints
- File size and count limits prevent abuse
- File deletion checks ownership
- SQL injection prevented by SQLAlchemy ORM

## Accessibility
- All interactive elements have proper ARIA labels
- Touch targets meet minimum size requirements (44px+)
- Forms are keyboard navigable
- Error messages are screen-reader friendly
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards

## Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Ensure `Uploads/products/` directory exists and is writable
- [ ] Configure file upload size limits in nginx/apache
- [ ] Test file downloads work correctly
- [ ] Test QC workflow end-to-end
- [ ] Verify mobile layout on real devices
- [ ] Check touch interactions work smoothly
