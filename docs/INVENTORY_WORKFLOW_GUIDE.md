# Inventory & Parts Management Workflow Guide

## Overview

The Inventory & Parts Management system integrates seamlessly with the Service CRM to provide complete inventory control, parts tracking, and automated stock management for service operations.

## Key Workflows

### 1. Initial Inventory Setup

1. **Product Creation**: Create products in the system with reorder levels
2. **Initial Stock Receipt**: Record initial stock quantities through receipt transactions
3. **Location Setup**: Define warehouse locations and distribute stock
4. **Reorder Level Configuration**: Set appropriate reorder levels for automated alerts

### 2. Job Parts Assignment Workflow

1. **Job Creation**: Installation job is created through dispatch system
2. **Parts Planning**: Service manager assigns required parts to the job
3. **Parts Allocation**: Parts are allocated from available inventory
4. **Technician Assignment**: Job is assigned to technician with parts list
5. **Parts Usage**: Technician marks parts as used during job completion
6. **Stock Deduction**: Inventory is automatically decremented when parts are used

### 3. Inventory Transaction Management

#### Receipt Transactions
- **Purpose**: Record incoming inventory from purchases or transfers
- **Process**: Create receipt transaction → Update stock levels → Generate notifications
- **Integration**: Can reference purchase orders from ERP system

#### Issue Transactions
- **Purpose**: Record outgoing inventory for jobs or transfers
- **Process**: Validate stock availability → Create issue transaction → Update stock levels
- **Automation**: Automatically created when job parts are marked as used

#### Adjustment Transactions
- **Purpose**: Correct stock discrepancies from physical counts
- **Process**: Compare physical vs. system stock → Create adjustment transaction → Update levels

#### Transfer Transactions
- **Purpose**: Move inventory between locations
- **Process**: Issue from source location → Receipt at destination location → Update both locations

### 4. Low Stock Alert Management

1. **Automatic Detection**: System monitors stock levels against reorder thresholds
2. **Alert Generation**: Low stock or out-of-stock alerts are automatically created
3. **Notification**: Inventory managers receive notifications about alerts
4. **Acknowledgment**: Managers acknowledge alerts and plan replenishment
5. **Resolution**: Alerts are resolved when stock is replenished above reorder level

### 5. Inventory Reporting and Analytics

#### Usage Reports
- Track which parts are used most frequently
- Identify usage patterns by job type, technician, or time period
- Optimize inventory levels based on historical usage

#### Stock Valuation Reports
- Monitor total inventory value across locations
- Track cost of goods used in completed jobs
- Support financial reporting and cost analysis

#### Low Stock Reports
- Identify all products below reorder levels
- Calculate suggested order quantities
- Track time since last receipt for each product

## Integration Points

2. **Buffer Stock**: Include 10-15% extra parts for contingencies
3. **Return Process**: Establish process for returning unused parts
4. **Cost Tracking**: Track actual costs for accurate job profitability

### Alert Management
1. **Daily Review**: Check and acknowledge alerts daily
2. **Proactive Ordering**: Place orders before stock-outs occur
3. **Supplier Relationships**: Maintain relationships for quick replenishment
4. **Emergency Stock**: Maintain emergency stock for critical items

### Reporting and Analytics
1. **Monthly Reviews**: Analyze usage patterns and adjust reorder levels
2. **Cost Analysis**: Track parts costs as percentage of job revenue
3. **Efficiency Metrics**: Monitor stock turns and carrying costs
4. **Trend Analysis**: Identify seasonal patterns and plan accordingly

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Stock Discrepancies
1. **Physical Count**: Conduct physical inventory count
2. **Transaction Review**: Review recent transactions for errors
3. **Adjustment Entry**: Create adjustment transaction to correct
4. **Process Review**: Identify and fix process gaps

### Missing Parts for Jobs
1. **Stock Check**: Verify actual stock levels vs. system
2. **Emergency Purchase**: Expedite purchase if critical
3. **Part Substitution**: Use alternative parts if available
4. **Job Rescheduling**: Reschedule job if parts unavailable

### Alert Fatigue
1. **Reorder Level Review**: Adjust reorder levels if too sensitive
2. **Alert Prioritization**: Focus on critical items first
3. **Automation**: Automate routine replenishment orders
4. **Dashboard Customization**: Customize alerts by priority

## API Integration Examples

### Adding New Stock Receipt
```bash
POST /api/v1/inventory/transactions
{
  "product_id": 1,
  "transaction_type": "receipt",
  "quantity": 100,
  "unit": "pcs",
  "location": "warehouse",
  "reference_type": "purchase",
  "reference_number": "PO-2024-001",
  "notes": "Weekly stock replenishment",
  "unit_cost": 0.10,
  "total_cost": 10.00
}
```

### Assigning Parts to Job
```bash
POST /api/v1/inventory/job-parts
{
  "job_id": 123,
  "product_id": 1,
  "quantity_required": 25,
  "unit": "pcs",
  "notes": "Screws for mounting brackets"
}
```

### Marking Parts as Used
```bash
PUT /api/v1/inventory/job-parts/456
{
  "quantity_used": 20,
  "status": "used",
  "location_used": "customer_site",
  "notes": "Used 20 out of 25 allocated screws"
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Indexes on frequently queried fields (organization_id, product_id, dates)
- Regular cleanup of old transaction records
- Partitioning for large transaction tables

### API Performance
- Pagination for large result sets
- Caching for frequently accessed stock levels
- Bulk operations for large data imports

### Real-time Updates
- WebSocket notifications for stock changes
- Event-driven alert generation
- Asynchronous processing for heavy operations

This workflow guide provides the foundation for effective inventory and parts management within the Service CRM system, ensuring optimal stock levels, cost control, and service efficiency.
