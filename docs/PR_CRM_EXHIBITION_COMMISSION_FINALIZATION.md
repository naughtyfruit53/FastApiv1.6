## Implementation Details

### 1. Commission Tracking System

**Database**:
- New table: `commissions` with 17 columns
- Indexes: 7 performance indexes
- Foreign keys: organization, sales_person, opportunity, lead, created_by
- Constraints: Data validation at DB level

**API Endpoints** (5):
```
GET    /api/v1/crm/commissions           - List with filters
GET    /api/v1/crm/commissions/{id}      - Get single
POST   /api/v1/crm/commissions           - Create
PUT    /api/v1/crm/commissions/{id}      - Update
DELETE /api/v1/crm/commissions/{id}      - Delete
```

**Features**:
- Person type validation: internal/external
- Commission type: percentage, fixed_amount, tiered, bonus
- Payment status tracking: pending, paid, approved, rejected, on_hold
- Rate validation: 0-100% for percentage commissions
- Amount validation: Non-negative values
- Audit trail: created_by, created_at, updated_at

**RBAC** (4 permissions):
- `crm_commission_read`
- `crm_commission_create`
- `crm_commission_update`
- `crm_commission_delete`

### 2. Lead Management Enhancements

**Ownership Filtering**:
- Regular users: See only assigned/created leads
- Managers with `crm_lead_manage_all`: See all org leads
- Admins: See all org leads

**RBAC** (5 permissions):
- `crm_lead_read`
- `crm_lead_create`
- `crm_lead_update`
- `crm_lead_delete`
- `crm_lead_manage_all`

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- Cross-organization access blocked

- Role changes apply immediately
- Bulk operations respect permissions

### 3. Exhibition Mode System

**Event Management**:
- Create and manage exhibition events
- Date/location/venue tracking

- Status management: planned, active, completed, cancelled

**Business Card Scanning**:
- File upload with OCR processing
- Automatic data extraction (name, company, email, phone, etc.)
- Confidence scoring
- Validation workflow
- Bulk scanning support

**Prospect Management**:
- Manual and auto-created prospects
- Lead scoring and qualification
- Interest level tracking
- Assignment to sales reps
- Follow-up scheduling
- Conversion to CRM customers

**RBAC** (10 permissions):
- `exhibition_event_read/create/update/delete`
- `exhibition_scan_create`
- `exhibition_prospect_read/create/update/convert`

**API Endpoints** (19):
```

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests
- [x] Schema validation tests (Pydantic)
- [ ] Model tests (to be added by QA)
- [ ] Service layer tests (to be added by QA)

### Integration Tests
- [ ] API endpoint tests (47 cases documented)
- [ ] RBAC permission tests
- [ ] Multi-tenancy tests
- [ ] Database migration tests

### Frontend Tests
- [x] Service integration (existing)
- [ ] UI component tests (to be added by QA)
- [ ] E2E tests (to be added by QA)

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Load testing (1000+ records)
- [ ] Bulk operation tests
- [ ] Query performance validation

## Deployment Requirements

### Pre-Deployment
1. **Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```
   - Creates `commissions` table
   - Adds indexes for performance

2. **RBAC Configuration**:
   - Create 21 permissions in permission table
   - Assign permissions to roles
   - Verify admin roles configured

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection
   - `SECRET_KEY`: JWT signing
   - OCR service credentials (if external)

### Post-Deployment
1. Run smoke tests on all endpoints
2. Verify RBAC permissions
3. Test multi-tenancy isolation
4. Monitor error logs
5. Check performance metrics

## Breaking Changes

**None** - This is a new feature addition with no breaking changes to existing APIs.

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are discovered:

1. **Rollback Migration**:
   ```bash
   alembic downgrade -1
   ```
   This will drop the `commissions` table.

2. **Revert Code**:
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-sha>
   ```

3. **Data Preservation**:
   - Commission data will be lost on migration rollback
   - Export commission data before rollback if needed
   - Exhibition and lead data unaffected

## Performance Considerations

### Database Indexes
- 7 indexes on commissions table
- Existing indexes on leads and exhibition tables
- Query optimization for list operations

### Query Optimization
- Pagination on all list endpoints
- Default limits prevent large result sets
- Eager loading disabled (load on demand)
- Organization scoping filters early in WHERE clause

### Caching
- Not implemented in this PR
- Can be added as future enhancement
- Consider Redis for frequently accessed data

## Known Limitations

1. **Export Functionality**: Stub implementation (needs completion)
2. **Bulk Commission Creation**: No batch API yet
3. **Email Notifications**: Not included in this PR
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Basic aggregations only
5. **OCR Accuracy**: Depends on image quality
6. **Webhooks**: No webhook support yet

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term (Next Sprint)
- Complete export functionality
- Add bulk commission creation
- Email notifications for approvals
- Enhanced analytics

### Long Term (Next Quarter)
- ML-based lead scoring
- Commission calculation rules engine
- Advanced reporting
- Mobile app integration
- External CRM integrations

## Dependencies

### Backend
- SQLAlchemy >= 2.0
- Alembic >= 1.13
- FastAPI >= 0.109
- Pydantic >= 2.0
- Python >= 3.12

### Frontend
- React >= 18.2
- TypeScript >= 5.0
- TanStack Query >= 5.0
- Material-UI >= 5.0

### External Services

## Risk Assessment

### Medium Risk Factors
1. **New Database Table**: Commission table requires migration
2. **RBAC Changes**: New permissions need configuration
3. **Business Logic**: Commission calculations critical
4. **Data Privacy**: PII in exhibition mode (names, emails, phones)

### Mitigation
- Comprehensive testing guide provided
- Rollback plan documented
- Data validation at multiple layers
- Audit logging for compliance
- Multi-tenancy isolation enforced
